      "Okay, here's how you can test your Node.js application that interacts with MongoDB using Keploy:\n",

      "\n",
      "    ```bash\n",
      "    keploy record -c \"npm start\"\n",
      "    ```\n",

      "\n",
      "2.  **Run Tests:**\n",
      "    Once you have recorded the interactions, you can run the tests using the Keploy `test` command. Again, replace `\"npm start\"` with your application's run command. The `--delay` flag gives your application some time to start up before tests begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```bash\n",
      "    keploy test -c \"npm start\" --delay 10\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "    Keploy will replay the captured API calls (test cases) and provide the captured MongoDB responses (mocks) whenever your application tries to interact with the database during the test run. This ensures your tests run reliably without needing a live MongoDB instance.\n",
